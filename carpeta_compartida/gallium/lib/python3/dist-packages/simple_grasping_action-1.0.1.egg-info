Description: Simple grasping action that sits on top of a joint-space interpolating controller exposing the FollowJointTrajectoryAction interface. It exposes a FollowJointTrajectory action interface, and goals consist of a trajectory to follow and an optional per-joint effort threshold. Execution is considered successful when for every joint either the desired trajectory has been traced or the effort threshold has been reached.
