====================

Welcome to your new robot application!

What are the next steps?

## Customize your application

By default, the template does not do anything useful. However, it demonstrates how to use *intents* to trigger behaviours or react to events.

*Intents* are usually generated by your robot's users. It can happen:
- through automatic perception (eg, someone approaches and seems to interact),
- through verbal interaction (eg, someone tells the robot to go somewhere)
- through interactions with the touchscreen (eg, someone presses a button to trigger a behaviour).

Your application template already contains examples of each of these possible interactions.

## Install on the robot

To install you app on the robot, you need to follow the following steps:

1. `pal_deploy` your code to the robot
2. install the webpages (if you are using any)

### Deploy the application controller to the robot

**To deploy the code to the robot, you *must* be running the following commands form within your Developer SDK Docker image!**

- from inside your Developer SDK Docker image, go to root of the project
- run `rosrun pal_deploy deploy.py --package {{ id }} ari-XXc` (replace `ari-XXc` by your actual robot)

You can now `ssh` onto the robot (`ssh pal@ari-XXc`, password `pal`), and go to your project: `cd ~/deployed_ws/share/{{ id }}`

### Install the webpages

To install your webpages onto the robot, check `pages/README.md`.

## Run your application

`ssh` onto the robot (`ssh pal@ari-XXc`, password `pal`), and start your
application: `rosrun {{ id }} run_app`



### Configure for automatic launch at start-up

You can also configure your app to automatically start when the robot is turned
on. See [the official
documentation](http://docs.pal-robotics.com/{{ robot | lower }}/sdk/latest/management/startup-apps.html).

Find more details at the [PAL Developer Center](https://docs.pal-robotics.com/{{ robot | lower }})
